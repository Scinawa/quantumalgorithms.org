# Preface

This is an [open source project accessible on GitHub](https://github.com/Scinawa/quantumalgorithms.org/) - only possible thanks to its many [contributors.](contributions-and-acknowledgements.html) The website is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0. We are searching for talented people and researchers to contribute: you can find a list of issues and enhancements that would improve this book further on the [issues list](https://github.com/Scinawa/quantumalgorithms.org/issues) for the GitHub repo, making recent material that keeps popping up in quantum information accessible to a larger audience.



The aim of this book is twofold:

- First, we want to bridge the gap between introductory material in quantum computation and research material.
- Secondarily, you should be able to use this book as a resource for state-of-the-art algorithms. Readers and scholars should find statements of theorems (along with their citations) and runtimes of the best quantum subroutines in literature, ready to be used in new quantum algorithms or applications.


These lecture notes were used to teach at:

- Politecnico di Milano (2019) - Quantum machine learning in practice.
- Politecnico di Milano (2021) - Applied quantum computing.

## Abstract

In these lecture notes, we explore how we can leverage quantum computers and quantum algorithms for information processing. It has long been known that quantum computation can offer computational advantages with respect to classical computation, and in this place we explore more the consequences of this intuition in current domains of computer sciences.

Why are we studying quantum algorithms? Studying how to use quantum mechanical
systems is already fascinating in itself, but we argue that having faster
algorithms is not the only reason for studying quantum computing. Studying
quantum computation might also reveal profound insights into new ways to process
information. For instance, it can give us ideas on processing data
in a secure way (though, quantum cryptography is not discussed in these notes).
Understanding the computational capabilities of quantum machines
is certainly an interesting thing to do. This might lead to understanding the
computational limits of nature: what can be computed in this world? Last
but not least, because of the interplay between classical and quantum
computation, many new *classical* algorithms have been invented (i.e. the
dequantizations of quantum machine learning algorithms, the classical algorithms
for Gibbs sampling, simulations of QAOA, etc..). This, in turn,
improved our understanding of physics, and ultimately of the world itself.
<!-- As some scientists believe\footnote{A friend told me this was originally an idea -->
<!-- of Miklos Santha}, quantum computing is the occasion for Theoretical Computer -->
<!-- Science to welcome contribution from Physics. As we know, TCS has (luckly) -->
<!-- welcome many contribution from Mathematical sciences, and at the current state -->
<!-- is basically a branch of Mathematics. With quantum computing, TCS can welcome -->
<!-- also contribution from physics, perhaps going towards the direction of a -->
<!-- "Physical Computer Science". -->
Another reason for studying quantum algorithms is that quantum computers are posing
a significant challenge to the *strong* Church-Turing thesis, which says that any "reasonable"
model of computation can be *efficiently* simulated on a probabilistic Turing machine (i.e. a Turing machine which has access to randomness).
However, there are some physical processes that we do not know how to simulate efficiently on classical computers, but for which we have efficient quantum algorithms! This is strong evidence that the strong Church-Turing thesis might be false!

<!-- Algorithms are often overlooked when thinking about speed of calculations. But they deserve more credit for the performance gains than the well known Moore's Law. As we can read [here](https://www.nitrd.gov/pubs/PCAST-NITRD-report-2010.pdf), some researcher tried to quantify the performance gains for some specific problem (linear programming and mixed integer programming), and they found that in 15 years we had an improvement of a factor of 43millions: a factor of roughly 1000 was due to increased processor speed, and a factor of 43.000 was due to algorithmic improvements for the problem.  -->

You might often hear that there are only two real quantum algorithms: phase estimation and the Grover's algorithm. This is somewhat true, but it is true in the same way that we have only 12 notes in the western temperate scale, and yet Pink Floyd were able to write [The Dark Side of the Moon](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_l1x-JAx0w53suECoCI0YJtW6VB8DBQWRQ) (and the other musicians came up with "the rest" of the music).

The common thread of these algorithms is that they are faster than their best classical counterpart. Oftentimes, (especially for ML) the runtime will depend only [poly-logarithmically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polylogarithmic_function) on the number of elements of the dataset, and it is usually only linear in the number of features (classical algorithms are often either linear in the number of elements and quadratic in the number of features, or depend on the number of nonzero components of the matrix and depend polynomially on other parameters of the matrix). The runtime of a quantum machine learning algorithm also often depends on characteristics of the matrix that represents the data under analysis, such as its rank, the Frobenius norm (or other matrix norms), the sparsity, the condition number, and the error we tolerate in the analysis. For this, along with an error-corrected quantum computer, we assume to have quantum access to a dataset. In other words, we assume that the data is stored in a quantum memory: the corresponding quantum version of the classical random-access memory.

We will see that, for a new QML algorithm, one often needs to make sure that the real performances of the quantum algorithms offer concrete advantages with respect to the effective runtime and the accuracy that is offered by the best classical algorithms. As we don't have access to big-enough quantum computers *yet*, we can only assess the performance of these quantum algorithms via a classical simulation.

These lecture notes should prepare the future quantum data analyst to understand the potential and limitations of quantum computers, so as to unlock new capabilities in information processing and machine learning. The hope is that this kind of technology can foster further technological advancements that benefit society and humankind, as soon as the hardware that supports this kind of computation becomes ready.

Last but not least, we will also cover important algorithms that are not necessarily related to machine learning, but are the quantum counterpart of important classical algorithms. Don't get swayed by the "lack" of exponential speedups. Remember: the square root of 365 days is a little less than 3 weeks. Besides this, big polynomial speedups, small polynomial speedups in important problems, or polynomial speedups proposing new algorithmic techniques are all much welcome in quantum computer science. All in all, quantum algorithms (to me) should be seen as a way for making **impossible things possible**. 

While reading these lecture notes you should always remember the good [Simon Martiel](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=upaq0vIAAAAJ&hl=en):
<p style="text-align:center">
"(quantum) Theoretical computer science is the fun part of mathematics."

To all of you, happy reading.
